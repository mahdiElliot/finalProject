TEX equations to neateqn converter preprocessor
===========================
Compile "project.cpp", run the execution file, write troff that contains equations starting with ".BL" and ending with ".EL" as input;
the output will be shown on the screen, it will also be in "out.txt".
Although The execution file is added to neatroff as a preprocessor and a new feature. If there is any error in compiling or syntax, the errors are available viewed in "error-log.txt".

Example:
input:
.BL
a \times \sqrt{{b ^ 2} ^ 2 \over {c_1 + d_2}}
.EL
output:
.EQ
a times sqrt { { { b sup 2 } sup 2 } over { { c sub 1 + d sub 2 } } } 
.EN

A wide example is available in "latexEq.txt", and the result is in "out.txt".
neatroff:

handled symbols and expresions:
greek and hebrew letters

delimeters

special charaters, some accents and symbols

standard function names

\left
\right
\Bigl
\Bigr

\exp

\sqrt {}
\frac{}{}
\overline {}
\underline {}
\overline {}
\over
\atop
\choose

pow symbol : ^ => sup
underline symbol: _ => sub

\sum
\prod
\coprod
\int

\hat{}
\tilde{}
\bar{}
\vec{}
\odot{}

also, if you want to have tex equations inline, you can use \delim like below which is similar to neat eqn delim definition:
.BL
\delim $$
.EL
$ a + \alpha ^ \beta $
.BL
\delim %%
.EL

% a + \alpha ^ \beta %
